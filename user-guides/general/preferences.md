# Preferences

Your Gibbon account has a number of settings, which you can control. These are located on the ___Preferences___ page, which you can access via the Minor Links section of the Gibbon interface: ![Preferences](/img/teachers/preferences.png)

### Options

*   ___Password___ - reset your password to keep your Gibbon account, and your school's private data, secure.
*   ___Personal Background___ - override the current theme's background image with one of your own choosing. Simply enter the URL to an image somewhere on the web.
*   ___Personal Theme___ - override the school's current theme with your own choice, to change the appearance of your Gibbon. Only themes installed by your school are available here.
*   ___Personal Language___ - override the school's default language, customising the interface to your language needs. This will be overridden, if you [select a language at login](/user-guides/general/logging-in).
*   ___Receive Email Notifications___ - choose to be alerted by email when you receive a system notification in Gibbon.

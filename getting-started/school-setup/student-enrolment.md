# Student Enrolment

## Admissions

The <u>People > Admissions</u> module enables you to manage student enrolment in the current school year, as well as view and accept application forms. As of v26, application forms can be created with the <u>System Admin > Form Builder</u> tool, which enables you to create different targeted applications with multiple pages, and customise the fields in your application.

On this screen, you have the 'Name' and 'Type' of the form.  'Pages' tells you the number of pages the form has.

If ‘Active’ is set to “Yes”, it implies the form is active and applications to the school are still being accepted using the form. 
“No” implies the form is not active or available for application processing. **Schools can use this feature to determine when student application process to the school ends.**

If ‘Public’ is “Yes”, it implies login to the school’s Gibbon portal is not required to access the admission application form, while “No” means only an authenticated Gibbon user can access the application form. **Schools can use this feature to determine when application to the school closes to the public.**


## Form Groups

The <u>People > Form Groups</u> module allows you to browse through the form groups (also known as Roll Groups in US English) in your school. In the main table, you can see the names of any form tutors, what room they are based in, and how many students are in each form group. There is also a View button that takes you to an overview of each individual form group.

At the bottom of the page is a Year Group summary, which shows heads of year if they are defined in the system, and the total number of students in each year.

# Importing Data

## Importing Users Into Gibbon

Gibbon allows you to use a variety of spreadsheet files (including CSV) to import data, including users, other systems and sources. There is a unified import tool, which can be accessed under ___Admin___ > ___System Admin___ in the main menu, and then ___Import From File___ in the module menu. 

This tool allows you to export a file structure, which can then be populated and imported.

# Notification Events

Many actions in Gibbon will generate a notification, which is sent through the Gibbon UI as well as by email. Notifications are sent to relevant users by default, such as application forms notifying the Admissions Officer. All notifications also exist as events that can be subscribed to.

To add users to a notification, go to <u>System Admin > Notification Events</u>, then edit the corresponding notification. Here, you can add and remove subscribers from an event.

All notification events correspond to an action in Gibbon, so the subscribed user must have permission to access that action before they will show up in the list of available users.

Some notifications offer additional scopes, to receive notifications for a only particular year group, or only those that pertain to a particular student. 

::: tip School Year Note
Notification events do not reset from one school year to the next, so when changing roles and adding new staff, be sure to also update the corresponding notification subscribers.

# Google Integration

If your school uses GSuite (Formerly Google Apps), you can enable single sign on and calendar integration via Gibbon. This process makes use of Google APIs, including OAuth, and allows a user to access Gibbon without a username and password, provided that their listed email address is a Google account to which they have access

1\. Log in to the [Google developer console](https://cloud.google.com/console/project). This requires that you have an account with administrative privileges on your G Suite domain.

2\. Once logged in you need to create a new project by clicking the ___Create Project___ button:

3\. In the new project set-up dialog, give your project a name. Click the ___C______reate___ button:

11\. Create an API key: [![](/img/admin/getting-started/08a-API-key-300x268.png)](/img/admin/getting-started/08a-API-key.png)

12\. Save the API Key for step 14: [![](/img/admin/getting-started/08b-API-key-created-300x158.png)](/img/admin/getting-started/08b-API-key-created.png)

13\. Leave the Key Restriction blank: [![](/img/admin/getting-started/10-key-restriction-300x281.png)](/img/admin/getting-started/10-key-restriction.png)

14\. Everything is now set up on the Google side, so you can enter your details into Gibbon by going to ___Home___ > ___System Admin___ > **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Settings</span>**. The details you need to enter into are as follows.

*   Google Developers Client Name
*   Google Developers Redirect URI (See step 9 above)

[![](/img/admin/getting-started/11a-Authentication-Gibbon-300x181.png)](/img/admin/getting-started/11a-Authentication-Gibbon.png) Use details from steps 7-8 or click on the Credentials tab: For the following use: Google Developers Client ID = Yellow Google Developers Client Secret = Red Google Developers Client Name = Blue Google Developers Redirect Url = Green [![](/img/admin/getting-started/11b-Client-id-285x300.png)](/img/admin/getting-started/11b-Client-id.png) API Key: [![](/img/admin/getting-started/11c-API-key-300x119.png)](/img/admin/getting-started/11c-API-key.png)

15\. Gibbon requires a single Google API, the Calendar API, which can be turned on via the Google Developer Console.

16\. On the Gibbon home page, you should now see a ___Sign In With Google___ button, which allows users to enter the system without their Gibbon username and password.

17\. When a user logs in using Google, their personal calendar, if not yet set, will be set to their primary Google Calendar.

18\. In additional, the school can specify a Google Calendar for all users to have in their timetable. To set this up, go to ___Home___ > **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Admin</span>** > ___Third Party Settings___ and set the ___School Google Calendar ID___
___School Google Calendar ID___ field to the ID of a shared Google Calendar.

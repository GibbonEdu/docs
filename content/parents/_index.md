### Parental Dashboard

As shown above, the dashboard shows you a summary of Today's Classes, Recent grades and Upcoming Deadlines. For more detail use the highlighted links.

### Planner

One of Gibbon's most useful features is the Planner, which allows you to see what is being taught in school. Located under ___Learn___ > ___Planner___ in the main menu, the listing gives you a choice to view lessons by date or by subject:

Use ![zoom](/wp/2013/05/zoom.png?classes=inline) icon to select a lesson and view more details. Once inside a lesson you can post chat messages, available to student, teachers and other parents.

#### Homework & Deadlines

The Planner also allows you to track homework, and look at upcoming deadlines (use the **Homework + Deadlines** section in the sidebar of the Planner):

### Markbook

The Markbook (___Assess___ > ___Markbook___ in the main menu) shows assessment details for to your child, organised by subject and school year. As well as grades, you may also see written comments, rubrics, uploaded responses and work samples:

## Data Updater

It is essential for parents to keep school updated on personal and medical data, as it helps keep all members of the school community informed and safe. Parents can use Data Updater (located under ___People___ in the main menu) to send requests to school for certain data changes:

*   Personal Data - such requests can be sent for both students and parents, and includes contact information.
*   Medical Data - such requests can be created for students, and are especially important in keeping students safe.

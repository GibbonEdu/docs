Gibbon supports storing and rendering of timetables using a non-grid-restrained approach. The timetable is created in a systematic, interactive procedure that is easy to achieve and understand. Before you proceed:

1.  You should have created the school year(s) and the term(s).
2.  You should have a list of all the days the school is active
3.  You should have a list of all the activities the school does in all days the school is on.
4.  This should be in terms of the periods, the times and the activities of a particular time set.

## Creating A Timetable

1.  Go to Admin > Timetable Admin
2.  Use **Manage Courses & Classes** to create courses, and within these establish necessary classes.
3.  Use **Course Enrollment** to assign teachers and students to classes.
4.  Use **Manage Columns** to create time structures for distinct day structure you have in your timetable cycle (e.g. if Monday, Wednesday and Friday follow one set of times, and Tuesday and Thursday follow one set of times, you will need two columns).
5.  Use **Manage Timetables** to create as many timetables as you need in a given school year. Most schools will require one timetable, but some schools (e.g. through schools) may require more. Each timetable in each school year can only be connected to one year group (e.g. you can have a timetable for Years 7-11 and a separate one for Years 12-13). In each timetable you can specify an entry for each day in your cycle. Each of these days is tied to a column (see step 4.), which gives it timing structure. Once the column is assigned, you can associate classes with a period in a day.
6.  The final step is to assign timetable days to calendar days, which is done using **Tie Days To Dates**. If no records show under **Tie Days to Dates** make sure you have set up school terms under School Admin > **Manage Terms** .

## Notes

*   Timetabling is always tricky. Gibbon's approach is a little tedious at times, but gives great flexibility. If you have any questions, check out our [support forum](https://ask.gibbonedu.org).

## Introduction

The following page explains how to use the Data Updater module to keep your school's data for students and families up to date. There are four types of data that can be updated: Family, Finance, Medical and Personal.

Be warned: depending on the size of your school, working through data updates can be a long process!

## Family Data

Family data updates keep track of information pertaining to families in a school.

## Finance Data

Financa data updates keep track of who invoices for school fees should be sent to. This is usually the student's family, but can also be a company that is paying fees on their behalf.

## Medical Data

Medical data updates keep track of student medical data. Some fields are mandatory: the student's blood type, whether they are on any long-term medication, and whether they have had a tetanus vaccine within the last ten years.

At the bottom of the Medical section is a checkbox that allows a medical condition to be added to a student. This section allows parents to go into more detail about any serious medical issues their child may have. When going through data updates, it is important to keep an eye on any updates that show a new medical condition, as this information may need to be relayed to other members of staff depending on risk level. There is an option in System Admin to send a notification to certain people when a new medical data update with a medical condition of a specified risk level is sent in.

## Personal Data

Personal data updates keep track of personal information about students and parents. This data update type has the most fields, and contains many important elements such as emergency contacts for students.

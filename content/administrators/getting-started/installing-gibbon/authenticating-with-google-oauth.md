If your school uses GSuite (Formerly Google Apps), you can enable single sign on and calendar integration via Gibbon. This process makes use of Google APIs, including OAuth, and allows a user to access Gibbon without a username and password, provided that their listed email address is a Google account to which they have access

1\. Log in to the [Google developer console](https://cloud.google.com/console/project). This requires that you have an account with administrative privileges on your G Suite domain.

2\. Once logged in you need to create a new project by clicking the ___Create Project___ button:

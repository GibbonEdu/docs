Users who have access to a reporting cycle will be able to see their progress in ___My Reporting___. This page lists any active reporting cycles and scopes that a user has access to: a user can be part of multiple reporting cycles at once.

Users with the `Write Reports_editAll` permission have a drop-down to select and view the My Reporting page for any user.

### Writing Reports

From the ___My Reporting___ page, users can click Edit to access the report writing screen. 

- **Write Reports**: This page displays a kanban-style board where students move between To Do, In Progress, and Complete categories as users write their reports.  This gives users a quick overview of what still needs done. Users can click any student in the list to write their individual reports, as well as access them in the sidebar. If there are Per Group criteria setup for a report, such as an overall comment per course, they are entered on this page.

- **Write Reports by Student**: Each reporting page begins with the student name and picture, as well as quick-links to bring up their profile, attendance, markbook, and past reports.

- **Comment Helpers**: As users write comments, the report system will check to see if the student name is present, and if any of the pronouns appear to be mis-matched. These are just helpers, users can feel free to ignore them if they're happy with the comment. Users can also paste a comment with a placeholder {name} and this will be automatically replaced with the student name.

- **Report Completion**: Each student report has a Complete checkbox. This tells the system that the report for this student is done, and displays a "Save & Next" button to quickly progress to the next student in your class. Users can always save incomplete reports with the normal "Save" button. The sidebar also highlights complete reports in green.

### Proof reading

There is built-in system for helping proof read other users comments. Users can easily view comments for a whole class, and suggest changes which the recipient can click to accept, reject, or edit and incorporate those changes.

- **Self-review**: When a user visits the Proof Read page, it will show them their comments by default. This screen lets users read and directly edit their own comments, as needed.

- **Peer-review**: At the top of the Proof Read page, users who have *Can Proof Read* access can select any other user from within their reporting cycle.

- **Proof reading**: When reading peer comments, selecting "Looks good" indicates that the comment has been proof read. Users can also select "Edit Comment" to suggest edits, as well as add an optional reason.

- **Saving**: There is a save button on every comment, for convenience. The whole page will save, so users only need to click Save as needed (not once per comment).
  
- **Reviewing**: As users edit each other’s comments, they will appear as Done or Edited in their own Proof Read screen. If edits have been suggested, users can see them highlighted on their page (removed text in red, inserted in green). From there, users can choose to Accept the changes, Decline them, or Edit and incorporate the changes into their comments.

- **Progress**: The progress bar at the top of the Proof Read page will fill up in green as comments have been proof read. Comments collapse automatically once they've been proofed, but users can expand and continue editing them with the arrow icon.

### Reporting Progress

Users who have been granted permission have access to the overall report progress screens. These are broken down by reporting cycle, by scope, and by person. There is also a page for viewing proof reading progress by scope.

## Introduction

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a short hand used to create mathematical and scientific symbols and formulas online. It requires a little study to use, but once mastered is very powerful. Gibbon incorporates LaTeX in its rich text editor, so that teachers can express complex formulas right in their unit and lesson plans, as well as in the form of HTML resources.

## Getting Started

You can use LaTeX anywhere in Gibbon that has a rich text editor. Simply switch from Visual to HTML views to get started: [![Editor](/wp/2015/09/Editor-1024x762.png)](/wp/2015/09/Editor.png) Once in HTML view, wrap your LaTeX code in a div tag, with class set to latex, as shown below: [![LaTeX Raw](/wp/2015/09/LaTeX-Raw-1024x93.png)](/wp/2015/09/LaTeX-Raw.png) When the content is saved and viewed, the LaTeX will be rendered, as below: ![LaTeX](/wp/2015/09/LaTeX.gif)

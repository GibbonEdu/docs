### Introduction

Crowd Assessment is like peer assessment, but bigger. When students submit work into one of your Lesson Plans, you can use Crowd Assessment to open the work up to a wider audience, who can respond with likes and comments. Your chosen audience might include class mates, other students, or even parents.

### Getting Started

To enable Crowd Assessment, [create a lesson in the Lesson Planner]({{< relref "lesson-planner.md" >}}), and whilst editing, enable the following:

*   ___Homework___ - so students know what work to do
*   ___Online Submissions___ - so students can submit their work into Gibbon
*   ___Crowd Assessment___ - so yourself, your students and a potentially wider audience can access the work.

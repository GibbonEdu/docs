### Introduction

Expenses require approval before they can be made against a budget. Use the introductions below to make a request against a budget you have access rights to, and you will receive [notifications](/user-guides/general/notifications) as your request makes its way through the approval process.

### Getting Started

1.  Go to **Other** > **Finance** in the main menu at the top of the page.
2.  Select **My Expense Requests** in the module menu
3.  Use the add button to create a new request, filling in all required fields.

1.  Important Notes:
    1.  You can only make requests from budgets that you have access rights to.
    2.  If you set Purchase By to "School", and your school has nominated a Purchasing Officer, that person will be notified to make the purchase once final approval has been granted.
    3.  If you set Purchase By to "Self", you can claim reimbursement through the system once you have made your purchase

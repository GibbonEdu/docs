### Introduction

Expenses require approval before they can be made against a budget. Approval takes place at the school and budget levels, and can take different forms, and involve different people, depending on the needs of the school, as described by the settings below

*   **Budget Level Expense Approval** - determines whether there is budget-level approval. If enabled, one of the staff members with Full budget access is required to approve a request, before school-level approval occurs.
*   **Expense Approval Type:**
    *   One Of - only one of a group of school-level approvers need to approve an expense at the school level.
    *   Two Of - two of a group of school-level approvers need to approve an expense at the school level.
    *   Chain Of All - all school-level approvers need to approve an expense, in a certain order.

Once final approval has been given for an expense request, the originating user is [notified](/user-guides/general/notifications) of its approval, and the purchase can be made. Depending on options selected along the way, a purchase officer or reimbursement officer might also be notified during or after this process.

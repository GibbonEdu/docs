### Introduction

Budgets allow the division and annual re-stocking, of financial resources, against which expense requests can be made. The following three concepts are useful in understanding how Gibbon's budgets work:

*   ___Budgets___ - these are generally departments or school functions (e.g. Maths, ICT, Activities), and are responsible for financial resource allocation. Budgets have staff members who can have the following types of access:
    *   Full (approve requests)
    *   Write (make requests)
    *   Read (view requests)
*   ___Budget Cycles___ - these are generally school or financial years or quarters, and are used to divide spending into time frames.
*   ___Budget Allocation___ - these are sums of money that are allocated to a budget in a given budget cycle.

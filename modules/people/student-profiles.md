### Introduction

Gibbon, being a combined school information management system (SIM/SIS) and virtual learning environment (VLE) collects and collates a lot of information on each student. As one of its key aims, Gibbon seeks to make this information available in an easily accessibly and clear fashion. This is achieved via Student Profiles, which are accessed via the Students module.

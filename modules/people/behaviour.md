### Introduction

The text below gives a brief description of how the Behaviour module functions to support pastoral care in school.

### Getting Started

To get started, go to People > Behaviour in the main menu.

### Overview

*   The behaviour modules maintains a set of behaviour records for students, where each record is one event or behaviour.
*   Events can be either positive (x helped y) or negative (x hit y).
*   When a positive comment is recorded, the student gets a "like" (e.g. gold star, merit, etc)
*   When a negative event is recorded, the students' form tutor will be notified.
*   Events have descriptors, which are like main categories (e.g. Being Nice, Helping Others, Working Together for positive, or Hitting, Fighting, Swearing for negative).
    *   These descriptors can be easily customised (or turned off all together) under Admin > School Admin > Manage Behaviour Settings.
*   Events have levels, which say how severe something is (e.g. Level 1, Level 2, Level 3).
    *   These levels can be easily customised (or turned off all together) under Admin > School Admin > Manage Behaviour Settings.
*   The teacher adding the record can do so for one student, or a group of students together.
*   When adding the record, an initial comment on the incident can be made. This can be added later, or follow up information can be placed in an individual box.
*   Form tutors see a summary of recent behaviour for their form on the home page.
*   A behaviour summer of each student is given in the behaviour module, and in the student profile.
*   There is a pattern spotter, for seeking particular types of behaviour.

# Useful SQL

:::danger PLEASE NOTE
**THIS PAGE IS NO LONGER UPDATED. ALL OF THESE USEFUL SQL QUERIES, PLUS MORE IN TIME, ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO RUN DIRECTLY IN GIBBON USING THE QUERY BUILDER MODULE. DOWNLOAD IT ON OUR [<span style="color: #ff0000;">EXTEND PAGE</span>](https://gibbonedu.org/extend/ "Extend").**

The following SQL statements can be run on a Gibbon installation in order to extract the specified data. Use of a mySQL client (such as [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net)) is be required to run these commands.

### Markbook Entries for Year Group

This example is for students in Year 11, but its effectiveness depends on your standard for naming courses (e.g. having "11" in your course name).
```
SELECT gibbonCourse.nameShort, gibbonMarkbookColumn.name, surname, preferredName, attainmentValue, effortValue FROM gibbonMarkbookColumn JOIN gibbonCourseClass ON ( gibbonMarkbookColumn.gibbonCourseClassID = gibbonCourseClass.gibbonCourseClassID ) JOIN gibbonCourse ON ( gibbonCourseClass.gibbonCourseID = gibbonCourse.gibbonCourseID ) JOIN gibbonMarkbookEntry ON ( gibbonMarkbookEntry.gibbonMarkbookColumnID = gibbonMarkbookColumn.gibbonMarkbookColumnID ) JOIN gibbonPerson ON ( gibbonMarkbookEntry.gibbonPersonIDStudent = gibbonPerson.gibbonPersonID ) WHERE gibbonSchoolYearID =(SELECT gibbonSchoolYearID FROM gibbonSchoolYear WHERE status='Current') AND gibbonCourse.nameShort LIKE '%11' AND gibbonPerson.status='Full' ORDER BY gibbonCourse.nameShort, gibbonMarkbookColumn.name, surname, preferredName;
```
### Subject Selections for Year Group

This example is for students in Year 12, but its effectiveness depends on your standard for naming courses (e.g. having "12" in your course name).

```
SELECT gibbonCourse.nameShort, gibbonCourseClass.nameShort, surname, preferredName FROM gibbonCourse JOIN gibbonCourseClass ON (gibbonCourseClass.gibbonCourseID=gibbonCourse.gibbonCourseID) JOIN gibbonCourseClassPerson ON (gibbonCourseClassPerson.gibbonCourseClassID=gibbonCourseClass.gibbonCourseClassID) JOIN gibbonPerson ON (gibbonCourseClassPerson.gibbonPersonID=gibbonPerson.gibbonPersonID) WHERE role='Student' AND status='Full' AND gibbonCourse.name LIKE '%12%' AND gibbonSchoolYearID=(SELECT gibbonSchoolYearID FROM gibbonSchoolYear WHERE status='Current') ;

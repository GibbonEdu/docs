## Gibbon Foundation

In 2023 the Gibbon Foundation was established to further support Gibbon as a sustainable, global project. The copyright of the Gibbon codebase has been officially transferred from Ross Parker, the founder of Gibbon, to the Gibbon Foundation. This change represents a milestone in the growth and sustainability of the project and its community.

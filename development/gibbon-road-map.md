## Looking To The Future

Version 25 was a landmark release for Gibbon, representing 12 years of development, 100 code releases and over 18,000 installations across the globe, all driven by a small but committed team of volunteer developers. In reflecting on where we have been, we are now setting our sights on where we are going next.

The establishment of the **Gibbon Foundation** marks the next step in Gibbon's growth, culminating several years work with lawyers, accountants and advisors to set up a non-profit entity incorporated in Hong Kong. Through this work, our hope is that the foundation will provide a secure legal framework for the ongoing development of Gibbon, with a focus on community development, intellectual property, advocacy and fundraising. This marks a major landmark in Gibbon’s transition from a “two-person band” (Sandra and Ross) to a sustainable, global project.
